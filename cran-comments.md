R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.2 and 
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and 
R-devel version on Win builder.

Sorry about another submission soon after the last, but an important
bug was discovered. This submission fixes that bug.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
