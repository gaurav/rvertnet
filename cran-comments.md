R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.2 and 
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and 
R-devel version on Win builder.

This version includes a new function and bug fix. In addition, 
this package now imports non-base functions explicitly as 
needed in accordance with R-devel changes.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
