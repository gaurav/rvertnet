R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.1.2 and R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This version includes many updates, including putting all examples in \dontrun instead of \donttest. Most functions work with web APIs, so are wrapped in \dontrun.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
